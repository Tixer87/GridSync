# 🏁 GridSync

**The meta dev tool for next-gen racing leagues.**

What happens when real-time telemetry, strategy logic, and race operations converge into one modular platform?

**Exactly. GridSync.**

Built for developers, race directors, and data-driven leagues.  
A core engine. A live layer. A system of systems.

Still hidden. But not for long.

Stay tuned – because GridSync isn’t just another tool.  
It’s the backbone of a new racing era.
